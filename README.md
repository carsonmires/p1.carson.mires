Elevator Design

The elevator I have chosen is this one, in a parking garage outside of campus

### Design

The design of this elevator is not bad, but I feel like it is a little cluttered.

* There is an unused panel at the bottom, which is unneccesary
* There are several keyholes included with labels that are unknown
* The labels have been worn down


### My Interface

The interface I have created is fairly similar to the example one used earlier, minus a lot of the unncessary features
