## Elevator Design

The elevator I have chosen is this one, in a parking garage outside of campus

### Design

The design of this elevator is not bad, but I feel like it is a little cluttered.

* There is an unused panel at the bottom, which is unneccesary
* There are several keyholes included with labels that are unknown
* The labels have been worn down

### My Sketch/New Design

A user interacts with the elevator in this general order
1. Walk inside
2. Press the floor which they want to go to (or don't if already pressed)
3. Wait inside elevator until at floor
4. Exit

A good way this elevator shows feedback, is by lighting up the button upon press. This is seen generally by all and tells that the button has been pressed.
My new sketch shows some improvement on some features inside of this elevator that could be implemented on a touch screen.

### My Interface

The interface I have created is fairly similar to the example one used earlier, minus a lot of the unncessary features
1. It includes easier to read braille
2. A side panel to show when the elevator is moving or not.
3. I have also centered the ALARM button at the bottom and eliminated the alarm button, reading the words makes it more apparent what the button is for, as a bell can be ambigious.
4. The close and open buttons are swapped, since most people use the close button more, having it closer to the door makes sense since it is what draws attention.
5. When the alarm is pressed, the entire panel goes away signaling that you pressed the alarm, and are waiting for help
